# str-fns

A collection of type-safe string functions written in pure JavaScript + JSDoc.

## Why str-fns

- I copy and paste useful functions from my notepad for every project using TypeScript/JavaScript. This library is a library of those functions.
- I need some useful functions to deal with `string` types in my projects. This library is a collection of those functions with type-safety.

## Why JavaScript + JSDoc / Why not TypeScript

[As Svelte team said](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/8569), TypeScript is a great tool for library authors, but not for library users.  
One of the reasons is that it is hard to jump to the definition of a function when using TypeScript.  
I want to make it easy to jump to the definition of a function, so I use JavaScript.  
Don't worry, I use JSDoc to make it type-safe.
